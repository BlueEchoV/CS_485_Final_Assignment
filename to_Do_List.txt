Game Design Document
	Theme:
		- Forest theme
	Win condition:

		- Player gets killed by the enemies
	Player: 
		- Can throw rocks at enemies
		- Unlimited rocks
		- The player has one life
	Enemies:
		- Enemies spawn more frequently as the time goes on
		- ALL ENEMIES ONE SHOT THE PLAYER
		- Large enemies (Spider)
		- Small enemies (Ants)
		- Maybe a ranged enemy (Bee shooting stingers)
	Fireflys
		- The score system/win condition
		- These are the boids in the background that the player can collect
		
TODO List:
	Michael P
		- DONE: BUG: Overlapping images
			- DONE: BUG: Player smearing
		- DONE: Create more background sprites
		- DONE: Rock exploding on hit 
		- DONE: Finish moving animations
		- DONE: BUG: Have the spider / lady bug spawn at the edge of the map
			- Have them spawn their width outside of the boundary and walk towards the player. (Could be a random 
			position within a range)
		- DONE (Sort of): Get ants spawning (Outside of map bounds)
			- Spawning enemies towards the player
		- TODO: Ammo system (Like in my game)
			- Ammo recharges and the player can spray the rocks / bullets out if they want to
		- TODO: Menu System
		- TODO: Insta death
			- Reset game states
		- TODO: Death animations for ants, spider, ladybug
			- When enemies die, play it
		- TODO: The image sizes aren't based off the screen size (Problem)
			- Changing this would affect the speed of the units as well (Problem)
			- We could just enfore that the screen be a certain size?
			- Or change it but that would be a problem
			- If we have the size be variable on the images, then we would need to scale the speed as well. 
			- This gets chaotic quick
			- Player could pick a resolution on load?
		- IDEA: Instead of a rock, have it be like a gun that shoots light or a ray gun thing and that effect gets stronger the 
		more fireflies you have. That could be really cool. Cat and mouse effect.

	Extra Bugs:
		- Images not based off the screen size (Many bugs)
	
	Michael B
		- Remove black margin
		- Animations
		- Level logic
			- Level image generates a random image when you press "Next Level"
			- Mulipliers (In the classes)
				Player
					(Maybe)
						- Button: Firerate +10%
						- Button: Speed +10%
				Enemies
				- Apart of the class (HP and Damage are CONST)
					- Spawn rate and maybe speed increase (caution)?
			- Scoring system (Picking up the fireflys) 0 / 50
			- Boss fight (Ever second round)
				- Think about boss mechanics 
			- Buttons
				- Next level: Weapon +10% Enemies +10% spawnrate
				- Game over: Red text "Game Over"
		- Collision Logic
			- Rock only dies when it hits a large enemy
		- Ants - Boids - Could make the variables stronger
		- Collision with the rock and the enemies
