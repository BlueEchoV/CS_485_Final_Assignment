Game Design Document
	Theme:
		- Forest theme
	Win condition:
		- Player catches all the fire flys
	Lose condition:
		- Player gets killed by the enemies
	Player: 
		- Can throw rocks at enemies
		- Unlimited rocks
		- The player has one life
	Enemies:
		- Enemies spawn more frequently as the time goes on
		- ALL ENEMIES ONE SHOT THE PLAYER
		- Large enemies (Spider)
		- Small enemies (Ants)
		- Maybe a ranged enemy (Bee shooting stingers)
	Fireflys
		- The score system/win condition
		- These are the boids in the background that the player can collect
		
TODO List:
	Michael P
		- Create more background sprites
		- BUG: Overlapping images
		- BUG: Have the spider / lady bug spawn at the edge of the map
		- BUG: Don't let the enemies overlap with the player 
		- Rock exploding on hit 
		- Finish moving animations
		- Death animations for ants, spider, ladybug
			- When enemies die, play it
		- Get ants spawning (Outside of map bounds)
			- Spawning enemies towards the player
			- Black box behind the fireflies
		- Ammo system (Like in my game)
		- Menu System
		- Insta death
			- Reset game states

	Michael B
		- Remove black margin
		- Level logic
			- Level image generates a random image when you press "Next Level"
			- Mulipliers (In the classes)
				Player
					(Maybe)
						- Button: Firerate +10%
						- Button: Speed +10%
				Enemies
				- Apart of the class (HP and Damage are CONST)
					- Spawn rate and maybe speed increase (caution)?
			- Scoring system (Picking up the fireflys) 0 / 50
			- Boss fight (Ever second round)
				- Think about boss mechanics 
			- Buttons
				- Next level: Weapon +10% Enemies +10% spawnrate
				- Game over: Red text "Game Over"
		- Collision Logic
			- Rock only dies when it hits a large enemy
		- Ants - Boids - Could make the variables stronger
		- Collision with the rock and the enemies
