			- DONE: BUG: Player smearing
		- DONE: Create more background sprites
		- DONE: Rock exploding on hit 
		- DONE: Finish moving animations
		- DONE: BUG: Have the spider / lady bug spawn at the edge of the map
			- Have them spawn their width outside of the boundary and walk towards the player. (Could be a random 
			position within a range)
		- DONE (Sort of): Get ants spawning (Outside of map bounds)
			- Spawning enemies towards the player
		- DONE: Fix the spiders stuttering
		- DONE: Ammo system (Like in my game)

			- Reset game states
		- DONE: Boss HP (other.hp -= damage)
			- 8 HP, spiders 3, ants 1
		- TODO: Menu System
		- TODO: Death animations for ants, spider, ladybug
			- When enemies die, play it
		
		- TODO: Multiple characters? Guy and a girl? Different weapons for both?
			- Guy throws a boulder to crush enemies
				- Goes through small units
			- Girl could have a 'crossbow' that shoots fast. 
				- Doesn't go through units buit shoots very fast 	
	Extra Bugs:
		- Images not based off the screen size (Many bugs)
	
	Michael B
		- DONE: Space bar moves the screen down (annoying)
		- Remove black margin
		- Animations
		- Level logic
			- Level image generates a random image when you press "Next Level"
			- Mulipliers (In the classes)
				Player
					(Maybe)
						- Button: Firerate +10%
						- Button: Speed +10%
				Enemies
				- Apart of the class (HP and Damage are CONST)
					- Spawn rate and maybe speed increase (caution)?
			- Scoring system (Picking up the fireflys) 0 / 50
			- Boss fight (Ever second round)
				- Think about boss mechanics 
			- Buttons
				- Next level: Weapon +10% Enemies +10% spawnrate
				- Game over: Red text "Game Over"
		- Collision Logic
			- Rock only dies when it hits a large enemy
		- Ants - Boids - Could make the variables stronger
		- Collision with the rock and the enemies
